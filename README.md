# Liturgo Tattoo

<a href="https://gusdkruger.github.io/liturgo-tattoo/" target="_blank">Github Pages Link</a>

Improved version of a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/senac-rs/" target="_blank">school</a> project where each student was given a random fictional client.

This is my first time using mobile first and i can't imagine not using it. It's so much easier to expand a layout to desktop than it is to shrink everything down.

Also tried to use clamp wherever possible and combined with mobile first it saved me a lot of media queries.

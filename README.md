## Development Notes

This project marks my first experience with a mobile-first approach, and I can't imagine working without it in the future. Expanding a layout to desktop from mobile is significantly easier than shrinking everything down. Additionally, I utilized clamp wherever possible, which, when combined with the mobile-first strategy, reduced the need for numerous media queries. Designing was definitely the most challenging part for me and having to design and build simultaneously didn't help, but overall, I am quite satisfied with the final result.
